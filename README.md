# data-structures

This is the Double-Linked List data structure. Unlike the Single-Linked List each Node has a reference in class to the previous and next node. The Double-Linked List itself is different in that it has a tail and head reference as opposed to just a head reference. The Double-Linked List methods have been adjusted and tested to incorporate these differences.
