test_graph.py, test graph2.py

graph2.py, create graph traversals per https://codefellows.github.io/sea-python-401d6/assignments/graph_2_traversal.html

priorityq.py, create priorityq per https://codefellows.github.io/sea-python-401d6/assignments/priority_queue.html

shortpath.py, compare Dijkstra's algorithm with Bellman-Ford algorithm, Dijkstra is faster, but
Bellman-Ford can handle graph with negative edges
