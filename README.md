# data-structures

A Queue is another type of Link-List Data Structure in which Nodes are incorporated and linked by references to each other. As the Queue's specific trait, it can be boiled down to FIFO(First in First out) as opposed to LIFO(Last in First Out) which is a normal Link-List. In short this is reference to how the nodes are popped or dequeued and pushed or enqueued.
